=head1 Utility Scripts

=head2 Overview

This directory contains the log scrapper and other scripts
that are the 'glue' for RPZLA.

Each script is described in its 'man page' which can be invoked
by calling the script with the '-m' option.

E.g for the rplza-bind script:

	rpzla-bind -m

will show its man page which describes its purpose, usage etc..

=head2 Log to DB Reformatting

The two log scrapers, one for bind and the other for apache, 
'tail' a log file (as specified in the config) and then ship
'matching' entries to the DB (again defined in the config).

'Matching' means that we expect this log entry in the DB.  For
BIND logs, that is pretty much everything.  For Apache, it gets
a little more complex.  One should be able to visit the 'walled
garden' (wherein is probably delivered information about the nature 
of the censorship and why it is happening) without generating
a DB entry.  This distinction is based on the 'official' name
of the walled garden, and is, again, defined in the config.
