=head1 Utility Scripts

=head2 Overview

This directory contains the log scrapper and other scripts
that are the 'glue' for RPZLA.

Each script is described in its 'man page' which can be invoked
by calling the script with the '-m' option.

E.g for the rplza-bind.pl script:

	rpzla-bind.pl -m

will show its man page which describes its purpose, usage etc..

=head2 Log to DB Reformatting

The two log scrapers, one for bind and the other for apache, are
composed of a 'filter' that tail's the relevant log and then
reformats that (extracting only the desired information) into
a form that the 'to-db' script wishes to see.

One can see, by examining the 'to-db' scripts that they do almost
nothing (join the date and time into one string) and then send
that data as an insert to the DB.

The key to this is that the data from the logs come in a format
expected by the 'filter' scripts.  As RPZ is a fairly new thing
for BIND these may change.
