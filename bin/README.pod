=head1 Utility Scripts

=head2 Overview

This directory contains the log scrapper and other scripts
that are the 'glue' for RPZLA.

Each script is described in its 'man page' which can be invoked
by calling the script with the '-m' option.

E.g for the rplza-bind.pl script:

	rpzla-bind.pl -m

will show its man page which describes its purpose, usage etc..
