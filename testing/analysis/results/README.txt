Each results file's name identifies the basename of the datafile
which is used for the analysis, and lists the bucket size (seconds).

Once can see that that data files that are limited to one domain,
show a regular structure in time and this is found for all bucket
sizes.

The data file which includes all domains has much less structure
in time, and the analyzer only finds a structure at bucket size 5 seconds.
