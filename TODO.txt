* Need to gather MAC addresses and include in submitted data.
  Nees to be done live at scraper level, as IP's change.  Provides
  the 'key'.  (yes MACs can be hacked, but most wont be).

  Not sure best way to do this.  Probably keep an in memory map
  of IP to MAC and fetch when a new IP is found.  Also, aging;
  drop 'old' mappings.  Lots of potential config: aging time etc.
  (See perl Net::ARP::arp_lookup('eth0') etc.; also ip(1) neighbour show)

  With that 'key' one could then, for example, allow a 'comments'
  section on a host: user defined content.

  AND !!!  we would really like to be able to query the LAN switches
  and identify which switch port the client is connected to, which
  may change over time.  i.e track the location and movement of the
  computer.

* Add 'select ... where ...' functionality:

  Each client_mac, query_domain, client_ip, client_hostname
  and responze_zone value becomes a link which specifies 
  the column name  and the value to be included.

  Use the same 'button groups' on the left, and then add a

    "where <col_name> = <value>"

  clause to the SQL query.  Simple.

  Can add links to all, but that just make the page huge.

  Better plan, create set on interfaces at the top:

  <pulldown col_name> <pulldown = or !=> <text field>

  add a new routine to rpzla.cgi which grabs this data and 
  then pass it down to RPZLA web/analysis/Mojolicious/Plugin/RpzlaData.pm
  if the text field is specified.  Thus user must cut/paste and 'Load Selecton'
