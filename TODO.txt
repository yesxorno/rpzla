* Need to gather MAC addresses and include in submitted data.
  Nees to be done live at scraper level, as IP's change.  Provides
  the 'key'.  (yes MACs can be hacked, but most wont be).

  Not sure best way to do this.  Probably keep an in memory map
  of IP to MAC and fetch when a new IP is found.  Also, aging;
  drop 'old' mappings.  Lots of potential config: aging time etc.
  (See perl Net::ARP::arp_lookup('eth0') etc.; also ip(1) neighbour show)

  With that 'key' one could then, for example, allow a 'comments'
  section on a host: user defined content.

  AND !!!  we would really like to be able to query the LAN switches
  and identify which switch port the client is connected to, which
  may change over time.  i.e track the location and movement of the
  computer.
