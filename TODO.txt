Bigger issues:

- error with '%' in IPv6 addresses (link-local)

- control over which zones get logged.

New UI
======

Product focus is on monitoring and identification of 
suspect systems.

Main Page
---------

Show data from DNS and Web graphically.  All clients
in the last X amount of time (perhaps just use the day/week/month
breakdown).

Would be quite nice to use the 'Tab' style (DNS / Web) to
show each without page reload.

See: http://jquerytools.org/demos/tabs/index.htm

Note that the graph package Flot already includes jQuery, 
which is nice.

Identification Page
-------------------

The problem is the lack of unique ID's (name, IP, MAC).

Idea is a table of columns of identification heuristics
(frequency, clumps, logarithmic etc.) with each row
being an ID with relevant summary of each heuristic.


Domain Analysis (as opposed to client)
======================================

Domains that are being followed (from DNS to Web):

	create view query_domains_followed as
	select distinct(w.query_domain)
	from web w, dns d
	where w.query_domain = d.query_domain
	order by w.query_domain;

Domains that are NOT being followed (only DNS queries):

	create view query_domains_not_followed as
	select distinct(d.query_domain)
	from dns d
	where d.query_domain 
	not in 
	( select query_domain from query_domains_followed );


One can them apply this with clients.  E.g

  select distinct(d.client_mac)
  from dns d
  where d.query_domain in
  (select query_domain from query_domains_not_followed);

  Make cleaner: need objects
